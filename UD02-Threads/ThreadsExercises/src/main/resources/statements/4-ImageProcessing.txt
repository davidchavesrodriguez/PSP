DU2 - Exercise 4 - Java Threads - Thread pool - Image processing

We want to create a multithreaded application.

The main thread must create a thread pool of size five.

Each thread must process an image placed in the resources/originals folder to convert its colours to grayscale.

Use the information given in the  following URL to perform the conversion:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/image-processing-in-java-colored-image-to-grayscale-image-conversion/

Place the processed images in a folder called results. The names of the processed images should be the same as the names of the unprocessed images not but with _grey at the end. Example: lion.png when processed should be lion_grey.png.

Once all images have been processed, the program should terminate.
