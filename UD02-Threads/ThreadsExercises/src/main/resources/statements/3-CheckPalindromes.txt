DU2 - Exercise 3 - Java Threads - Callable

We want to create a multithreaded application.

The main thread must create an array of ten words. That main thread must create ten threads whose job is to check whether a word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, verse or even number that reads the same forwards or backwards.

Examples of palindromes:

    kayak
    deified
    rotator
    repaper
    deed
    peep
    wow
    noon
    civic
    racecar
    level
    mom

The main thread must indicate in the standard output for each word whether it is a palindrome or not.
