DU2 - Exercise 5 - Java Threads - Thread pool - Download files

We want to create a multithreaded application.

The main thread must create a thread pool of size ten. Use the file animal-urls.txt to get the URL from which download files.

Each thread must download a file from one of the URLs in animal-urls.txt.

Place the processed images in a folder called results. The names of the processed files should be animali.jpg where i is the number of the line in animal-urls.txt where the URL of the file is placed.

Once all files have been processed, the program should terminate.
