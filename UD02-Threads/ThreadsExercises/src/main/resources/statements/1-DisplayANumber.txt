DU2 - Exercise 1 - Java Threads - Runnable

Create a Java class that implements the Runnable interface.

The run() method of the class must do the following:

    Display a welcome message with the name of the current thread.
    Repeat five times:
        Get a random number between 10 and 500 (use java.util.Random).
        Pause the execution of the current thread for the number of miliseconds equal to the random number obtained above.
    Display a goodbye message with the name of the current thread.

Create a Java executable class to launch two threads created using the previous class. Thie main thread waits for the other two threads to finish and then displays a message indicating that it has finished.
