A person wants to reduce the number of candles to be used to celebrate their birthday.\
To achieve this, the person is going to set their new age in binary.\
Each candle will represent one bit, and the candle will be lit to represent a 1, or extinguished to indicate a 0.\
As a result, not only will she use far fewer candles, they won't even have to light them all!\
The person is so confident that she will finally be able to blow out all the candles that they are even determined to put their age in seconds.

**Input**\
The program will read, from the standard input, a first number indicating how many test cases will come next.

Each test case is an integer number with the person's age in seconds.

**Output**\
For each test case the program will write the number of lit candles the person will have to put on his birthday cake, knowing that it represents the number in binary.
