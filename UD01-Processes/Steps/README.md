# Project Steps
Suppose a person who is able to climb several steps in one go.
This ability has led them to travel the world participating in so-called vertical races, such as the world's oldest and most famous tower race in which participants must climb the 1576 steps of the Empire State Building.
A normal person would need 1576 steps to climb all those steps. Climbing them two at a time, 788 would be enough, and three at a time only 526.

## Input
The first number in the input indicates how many test cases are to be processed.

It is followed by a line for each test case, with two numbers between 1 and 1,000,000. The first one indicates the number of steps and the second one indicates how many steps can be climbed at a time.

## Output
For each test case the minimum number of jumps needed to climb all the rungs shall be written.
