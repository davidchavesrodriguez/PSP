DU1 - Exercise 10 - Java ProcessBuilder - count vowels

Create a program that is able to count how many vowels are in a file. The parent program must launch five child processes, each of which will count a particular vowel (which can be either lower or upper case). Each vowel-counting process must leave the result in a file. The parent program will then retrieve the results from the files, add up all the subtotals and display the final result on the screen.

For the file given as example fileData.txt the results would be:

Number of A: 23

Number of E: 45

Number of I: 16

Number of O: 18

Number of U: 7

Total number: of vowels: 109
